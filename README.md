# Project Overview

This project is part of the Udacity Grow with Google front-end nanodegree program and involves writing code to TEST a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer(s) of the application saw the value in testing, as they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they did not finish---that's where I come in.  It was up to me to finish coding the tests: a total of four test suites containing seven tests.

## Why this Project?

Learning and knowing how to write code to test applications is an important skill to have! Especially since testing is becoming such an integral part of the development process. Many organizations now practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## What will we learn and how will it help?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams... or joining a new company.
* Good tests give us the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within our codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

#  Dependencies

The repo contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Jasmine to run and complete the tests. (All of the tests were written with plain, vanilla JavaSript).  In addition, Google fonts (Roboto) are utilized.

I also want to acknowledge and give MANY thanks to Ryan Waite for his wonderful YouTube walkthrough of this project. His concise comments and easy-to-see examples guided my development of this project.

# Getting, Running and Using the code

You may clone or download this repo to use the code.  Simply open 'index.html' with your browser (I prefer Chrome) to run the project. You will find the test code in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.  Feel free to examine the code to see how it works.  Also be sure to review the HTML and CSS to see the interaction with feedreader.js.
